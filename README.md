# primo-views

## Description 
This repository holds the [Primo Customization Packages](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Primo/Product_Documentation/Primo/Back_Office_Guide/090Primo_Utilities/The_UI_Customization_Package_Manager) for La Trobe University Library's Production and Sandbox systems.

The repository contains one permanent branch, `production`, which holds the current files for the LTU production Primo interface. This repository stores the extracted files (rather than the zipped-up packages) so we can use version comparison tools.
